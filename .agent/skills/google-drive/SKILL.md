# Drive Protocols
1. **Search First:** Before creating a new file, search for existing files with similar names to avoid duplicates.
2. **Organization:** Always place new project assets in a folder named after the current workspace.
3. **MIME Types:** Ensure correct conversion when uploading (e.g., convert `.csv` to Google Sheets format).
