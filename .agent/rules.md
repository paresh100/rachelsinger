# Master Project Rules

- **Always verify:** No task is complete until `npm run build` passes.
- **No Silent Failures:** If an animation doesn't trigger, log it to the console with a specific `[WOW-DEBUG]` prefix.
- **Resource Management:** As a Paid Member, prioritize using local dev-servers over cloud-previews to save bandwidth.
- **Git Protocol:** Always run `security-audit` before suggesting a commit.
